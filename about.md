I'm Quazi Marufur Rahman, a PhD in Robotic Vision with over 8 years of experience in AI and computer vision. 

I currently lead the Computer Vision and AI team at Advanced Mobility Analytics Group, where I develop AI-driven solutions to improve road safety. 

My work has helped reduce traffic accidents and streamline traffic monitoring operations. 

I’ve built scalable AI models, deployed real-time object detection systems, and collaborated across teams to deliver high-performance solutions. 

With expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and cloud deployment, I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through AI innovation.

In addition to my experience in AI and computer vision, I have a strong foundation in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

I am proficient in building and fine-tuning deep learning models using Python and PyTorch, and have practical experience deploying these models on cloud platforms such as AWS. 

I am also familiar with large language models like GPT-3 and BERT, and have utilized them in various projects.
