After completing my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, I earned my PhD from Queensland University of Technology, Australia, under the supervision of Dr. Feras Dayoub in September 2021.

My PhD research, titled "[Performance Monitoring of Deep Learning Vision Systems During Deployment](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/229733/1/Quazi%20Marufur_Rahman_Thesis.pdf)", focuses on improving the reliability and accuracy of vision systems in mobile robots. I developed new methods to handle challenges in monitoring object detection and semantic segmentation performance.

These advancements help us better monitor deep learning vision systems during deployment, without needing ground truth labels.
